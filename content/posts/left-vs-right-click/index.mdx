At this moment I spent one month working for the Digital Summer Camps and this morning I was thinking about a funny fact.

Every week I got – at least – five children who have ever used a PC before.

This means they don’t know the left and right-click. And how to use the keyboard, too.

I remembered a video that shows *[how teens react to Windows 95](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucCxtgN6sc)*, but I believe this situation is difference.

PCs and laptops are still in use, however children use more and more mobile devices.

Now, think if this trend becomes bigger and they grow up without interact with a PC, just using two thumbs for all the time.

Incredible, could be?
