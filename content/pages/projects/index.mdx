## Living in Denmark

Moving is not always easy, and moving to a new country can be even more challenging 
if the main language is not your mother tongue.  Over time, I have expanded this list, initially with resources for finding 
places to live in Copenhagen, and occasionally adding other useful resources and websites. 

I maintain this list on GitHub to make it easier for people to settle into life in Denmark.

## OpenStreetMap POIs

This Python package allows to query OpenStreetMap API using OverPy and retrieve all nodes and ways included in a area. 
It is possible to load a list of polygons using GeoPandas (JSON, GeoJSON, Shapefile are supported) and loop through them.

The goal is to associate for every area a list of POIs retrived from OpenStreetMap. 
The query will be performed on the bounding box built around the given polygon.

## VirtualDojo

Due to COVID-19, [CoderDojo Padova](http://www.coderdojopadova.it) decided to conduct 
its activities online during the lock-down in Italy. We teamed up with several clubs all over Italy 
and we reached almost 60 participants. I contributed to develop **VirtualDojo**.

This is open source platform which wraps [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/) through its
public API and offers a realtime dashboard where it is possible to manage multiple users and rooms.

## 200 Metri da Casa

During the COVID-19 lockdown, people living in the region of Veneto
were allowed to walk around a radius of 200 meters from their house.
This webpage renders a map with their location and the allowed area.
