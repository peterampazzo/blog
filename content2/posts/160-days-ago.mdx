I suppose you're asking yourself what happened 160 days ago, aren't you? I launched a new project,&nbsp;<a href="http://instagram.com/pierreframes">pierreframes</a>.

Well, actually this is an Instagram account: here I publish pictures taken only by Canon cameras during my travels all over the world!
The name <em>pierre&nbsp;</em>stands for my name's initials P and R.

Yes! I've lots of gigabytes of pictures taken during my trips in California and in various places in Europe to share! :) I'm posting in a spontaneous way, indeed I've to confess that it's really hard to choose the right picture to publish.

Hope you'll start following <a href="http://instagram.com/pierreframes">@pierreframes</a>! ;)
